I am rather too young to have missed it, but I should like to have, so I sat in the right transept, and listened to the first act, which was a fine performance by the playwright Antonio da Murano. It was a very serene and serenely beautiful performance, and the actors did their best, as one would wish they could have done in their youth. --But I'm getting to the point already.
