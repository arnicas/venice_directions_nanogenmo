The old Venetian did not care about appearances. He did not care if people did not like him. He would not have you listen to him.

-But I forgot where I was going with this.

You will come to the artwork, Monumento ai Tetrarchi. You see the sea through the window. If you look out of the window, you will see the water at the foot of the steps. The water is very refreshing, and it is good for exercise. The train journey from Padua to Venice is the quickest way to get to Venice. The journey takes about forty minutes. The train station at Venice is just before the station at Castello. There are tickets for the train station and the train station itself.

You will find the Sotoportego del Lovo. You see things. It has a sense of order and regularity that some other city cannot match. As a matter of fact, the reason for the great difference between the people of Venice and the people of other cities is not so much that the Venetians are more intelligent than the other people, as that the great majority of the Venetian population are intelligent. The Venetians are a very highly cultured people, but they are not so highly cultured as to make it a high priority to educate them.

Now veer left onto the Sotoportego del Casin dei Nobili and just past the cat who sits there (is this cat following you?).

You will see the San Marco, an information. You see the fish on the rocks. Your boat is at once safe and comfortable. The gondola leaves the pier at once and disappears under the bridge. A few moments later, you enter the water again. You take a gondola seat and lie down in the sun. It is a very peaceful sensation. The sun is just sinking into the sea. The gondola leaves the pier and disappears into the sea. You look out and see nothing. You wait. The gondola comes out again and you feel perfectly at home again.It is a scene of exquisite serenity.

-But I forgot where I was going with this.

You will find yourself in the square the Campo San Biasio.

You will find the San Giorgio. You see a group of porticos, and you look round at the vastness of the square, and the marvellous richness of the buildings; but you feel that you are in a pompous city of the rich, where every hand is at work in the streets, and no mind is allowed to rest. You pass under the bridge, and the old gondolier gives you a smile that makes your hair stand on end. He is a fat, hirsute fellow, with a satisfying, mischievous face, and a large, broad mouth. He has been in Venice for a very long time, and you think him very dull.

Don't forget to after the seventh turn, take a left after the passageway the Calle Seconda del Cristo.

You will see the restaurant, Ristorante Beppino. You see little barges coming and going, or barges and gondolas moored to the sides of the canals. The barges seem to float in the water. The gondolas are small, and have no life of their own. They are used for taking visitors around the city. They are quite graceful. They are of the Venetian type, with their long pointed caps and their long necks, and they have a certain air of dignified ease and finess.

Here is a nice big square, the square the Campo Sant'Agostin.

-But I forgot where I was going with this.

Now veer right onto the Calle del Paradisio and just past the cat who sits there (this cat seems familiar).

You will see the restaurant, Osteria Antico Giardinetto. You see gondolas bobbing about the water. The gondolas are a sign of the rising prosperity of the city, as they are the sign of the increasing power of the nobility. There are three types of gondoliers. The first, who are rarely seen, are the men who wait at the prow of the gondola to take you to the pier. They wear red or white or blue trousers, and are very handsome.

You will see the restaurant, Ca'Eolia. You see nothing but tall buildings and dark, shadowy lines. You hear nothing but the sound of the rushing of the lagoons. You look out of the window and see nothing but a black mass of water. You turn and walk on. The silence is incredible. How can you explain this to yourself? There is a hotel on the other side of the campo, called the Palazzo Giusti, which you can stay at. It is the old Palazzo Giusti, with the beautiful figures of the Venetian Lion on the top of it.

Now you will arrive at the Bacino San Marco. You see the sea in a way that only a child, or a madman, could have done. The light is on, but no one is there to see it. The only thing that is there is the little black boat. The air is filled with the sweet, shrill cry of the gondola. After the carnival the canal of the Giudecca is the best thing in Venice. It is a marvellous, deep-water canal with a beautiful calm at the water's edge. The gondolas are of course there, but you do not see any of the city’s shops or other buildings.

Then, hire a boat at the Rio San Barnaba. Get out when you reach the the Calle de le Rasse.

Don't forget to take a boat at the the Rio de le Terese. Ask to be let off at the Residenza Grandi Vedute, an apartment.

-But I forgot where I was going with this.

Hire a boat at the Rio de San Vio. Look for the cheaper water taxis first.

Now you will arrive at the Rio de Santa Caterina. You see gondolas bobbing in and out of the water. The gondoliers have the appearance of a pack of wild dogs. The best way to see Venice is from the water. From the train station you can get a good view of the city on the morning of the 9th of March. It is a fine day and a nice breeze is blowing. Venice is a very picturesque city. It has a pleasant landscape. It has a charming old-world air.

It is made of a block of marble, and is carried by a rook or gondolier. The gondola is propelled by a rope. The gondola is carried by a rope. It is tied to a boat by a rope. Gondolas are not for the faint of heart. They are heavy, and draggy. Gondolas are for the very best.


<img src='images/image_34.jpg'>


You will come to the pharmacy, Farmacia Morelli. You see the water rushing back and forth on the canals. In the morning, the water is so deep that it looks like a pool of blood. Venetian people do not like the water. It is unpleasant. It is a very beautiful color, but not pleasant. People in Venice hate the water. They think it is a color that is to be washed down with. It is unpleasant, and one sees it in the people. One hears it in their cheerfulness. The people love the water.

The Palazzo dei Signori, built in 1484, is one of the most imposing in Venice.

Now go straight on for 5 minutes past the Arcangelo Uriele, an artwork.

You will come to the Cafe Internazionale, a restaurant. You see the night sky, and the stars are all night long. The stars are dancing on the silver waves, and the sea is soft and silvery. On the other side of the Grand Canal, at the other side of the mountains, is a long line of buildings, gilded and glazed, with lovely figures in them,--some of them, no doubt, statues of saints or of noblewomen,--standing out like ghosts against the sombre blue sky.

You hear the people running toward the sea. You get into an ordinary gondola and take the gondola across the water. You get out, and look around you. There is no water. You can not swim. The gondola is too heavy. You have to lie down on the water. You ask yourself, What is the matter? Then you look around. You see that there is no time to be in any hurry.

Take the third right after the passageway the Ponte Trevisan.

You will find the Calle San Cosmo. You see them coming; they are going down the line, and you see them coming again, and again--as they come, you see them coming up and down, and again. The gondola is like a machine which the minute tranquillity of which is to the gondolier a very happy accident. The gondolier, like a clock, is at work. He is the master of the whole line. He will stop the gondola at every moment, and let it go no more, if it will give him the honour of stopping it.

Now, turn right after the passageway the Corte Cavanela and go past the dogs, who might follow you for a while.

You will find the Campo a Fianco la Chiesa. You see people sitting on the pavement, on the water, their shoes on the water, and on the water. People in Venice use their knees on the water. It is the best possible place to sit. There are, of course, better places for sitting. One is in the centre of the Piazzetta, in the old palace by the Piazzetta entrance. It is very comfortable. The Piazzetta is the best place to sit in Venice. Another is at the foot of the steps at the top of the steps.

It is a pretty little place, with a church and a fountain and a few houses. You sit there, and the city seems to mould itself to your will. You feel that it is all right. You come to the river--it is a beautiful thing--and take a tender plunge. There is a campo farther on, which you take a seat in. It is not very far away. There is a little more to the canal.

You will find the Calle seconda de la Fava. You see in the fog the large blue, white, and red boats which are used by the police to sweep the streets. In the rain the boats look like miniature canals. The officers on the prow look like cavalry. As the canals are very narrow, they look like miniature canals. The officers on the rail are like cavalry. In fact, they are miniature canals. The police officers on the rail are like cavalry.

-But I forgot where I was going with this.

You will see the restaurant, Bucintoro. You see the black clouds that have covered the night sky. You pass under the bridge with the sound of rushing water. The night has gone, but the dawn is still.
